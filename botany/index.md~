## Flora of Ontario

The following key is derived from the
[Flora of North America](www.fna.org), based on data scraped from the
website using a Python program I am writing. It’s not yet complete, but
hopefully I’ll have most of the Cyperaceae covered before the spring. Check
back for updates!

UPDATE: March 18, 2013

The key now contains all the Ontario Carex. In theory, it is now complete,
except for Cyperus. The Cyperus isn’t online, so it will have to be added
by hand. All the rest of the sedges are there now. The next step will be
checking for translation errors, and rationalizing the keys.
