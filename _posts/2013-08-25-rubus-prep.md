Collecting blackberries and their relatives (*Rubus* spp.) for herbarium
study is particularly challenging, and even experienced field-botanists may
not appreciate everything that is involved. More than in other vascular
plant groups, to make a good *Rubus* specimens, you need to understand a
bit about the their life-cycle.

Blackberries, and most other *Rubus*, are perennial shrubs. However, their
stems, called canes, are biennial. In the first year of growth a cane
remains in a vegetative state, and does not flower. Usually, it doesn't
even form any side branches. These canes are referred to as **primocanes**.
At the end of the season, buds form in the leaf axils and at the shoot tip.

In the second year of growth, flowering shoots will emerge from these buds.
At this stage, the cane is called a **floricane**. Growth stops after the
fruits are formed; the floricane doesn't produce any over-wintering buds.

A mature blackberry plant produces both primocanes and floricanes at the
same time. The floricanes start earlier in the season, since they get a
head-start building from last year's primocanes. By the time the flowers
appear in June or early July, the next batch of primocanes are only just
beginning to emerge from the underground rhizome.

Unlike other angiosperms, blackberry flowers aren't generally useful
taxonomically[^1]. The really interesting characters are the
primocane leaves, the stem armature (prickles, bristles, hairs and glands)
and the mature inflorescences of the floricane. This means the best time to
collect specimens is later in the season, when the fruits are forming or
ripe and the primocanes are well developed.

[^1]: What I should say here is that flowers have not been found useful by previous taxonomic research on blackberries. Sadly, previous taxonomic research on blackberries is quite a mess, and I am prepared to accept that anything I think I know about this group is completely wrong. 

With this in mind, based on two years' intensive collecting, we currently
use the following protocol for preparing my specimens:

First, confirm that you are collecting both a floricane and a primocane,
and they both come from the same rootstock. This is important, as we've
seen a lot of mixed populations!

<figcaption><em>Rubus</em> rhizome, confirming the primocane and floricane are
part of the same plant. The upper cane is the primocane, and the lower one
is the floricane. Primocanes are usually green, and floricanes usually red. 
This can vary though!</figcaption>

You make at least two separate sheets for each plant. For the first, select
a representative section of the cane from the central part of the
primocane, with a few well-formed mature leaves attached. The cane tips are
easily damaged, and don't generally press well. Similarly, the leaves at
the base of the cane are often damaged or misshapen.

Pressing the leaves is tricky, particularly on prickly specimens. Keep in
mind that on the mounted sheet you will want to see the intact outline of a
complete leaf, as well as examples of the upper and lower surface of the
leaves.

upper and lower surfaces will be visible.</figcaption> 
</figure>

Make sure the specimen includes a nice segment of the most heavily-armed
section of the stem. Sometimes the best leaves and the nastiest prickles
are on different sections of the stem. If this is the case, include a
section of the prickliest part of the stem, with the leaves removed, in
your sample.

collection</figcaption>

Use a second sheet, with a separate newsprint folder, for the floricane.
Get a section of the stem with two or three well-formed inflorescence
branches. Again, the little shoots at the very top or bottom of the cane
are often misshapen, so use the center of the cane. As for the primocane,
make sure you've got a section of the prickliest cane.

Floricane leaves are incredibly variable. If you can include a few
well-formed leaves in the folder, great. They don't get much attention
taxonomically, though, due in large part to their inconstancy.

If you're collecting tissue for DNA work, the freshly-formed leaves at the
end of the primocane are the best source. I had some bad experiences as a
grad student, and so I collect enough for at least four extractions, and
four flow cytometry analyses. Typically 50-100 cm<sup>2</sup>.
Double-bagged, with labels inside and out in case of catastrophe.

Finally, make sure you note the habit of the plant for the label. The major
growth forms include:

- highbush blackberries, with upright, ascending, or somewhat arching stems
  that don't reach the ground and don't root at the tip 
- doming forms, that start out upright, but arch and may or may not root
  at the tips, possibly trailing along the ground as well
- trailing forms, which may either grow prostrate on the ground, or trail
  and scramble over other low vegetation

Do your best to describe what you see. It can be challenging to determine
if you're looking at a trailing form, or a highbush form that is now
growing on the ground after having been weighed down by snow or fallen
branches. Furthermore, some highbush species will look strange and stunted
when growing in poor conditions.
            
The shape of the inflorescence should be visible on the sheet. The fruits,
however, will either rot or dry down to a pile of seeds. So definitely
include a note on their size (length and width). Also flavour, if you get
some ripe ones. Better in your belly, with a good description on the label,
than pressed into mash untasted!
            
Note that this protocol reflects the minimum necessary material for a
useful herbarium collection. If you have time and space for more than two
sheets, and you see interesting bits you'd like to include, you can always
collect more. Some of our collections include five or six sheets for a
single plant.
