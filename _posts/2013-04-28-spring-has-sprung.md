It hit 23<sup>o</sup> Celsius in Ottawa today, so I packed my camera and
headed out to <a title="Mer Bleue"
href="http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/places-to-visit/greenbelt/mer-bleue">Mer
Bleue</a> for my first photo trek of the season. It'll be another week or
so before the spring wildflowers get into full swing, but I came back with
a great preview.

Red maple flowers before the leaves come out, giving the tree a red halo
that it quite striking against the bare branches. Silver maple, <em>Acer
saccharinum</em>, flowers are similar, but yellow-green rather than red.
They bloom about a week earlier, but their season is long enough allow for
occasional hybrids to form. The male and female flowers are usually on
separate branches, and young trees may have only one sex or the other.
These blooms were on the big tree at the start of the Mer Bleue boardwalk.

The fresh anthers are bright red. They split open to reveal the yellow
pollen. As the pollen is shed, the dull red inner surface of the anther
remains briefly before the flower falls apart. The shiny spot at the base
of the flower is the nectar produced to attract insect pollinators.

Sterile anthers are visible at the base of the female flowers. The tiny
ovaries are already shaped like miniature maple keys, surrounded by a
swollen nectary. You can see these features with a hand lens, but it's too
small for me to get a clear picture with my SLR.

I got a nice view of the female flowers out at the road. There were also
some small, apparently all-female trees right at the start of the
boardwalk.

I've never stopped to look at young Tamarack cones before. The female cones
have a rich pink-red colour, which contrasts nicely against the new green
needles. Being deciduous, the needles will be gone by the time the cones
mature into the more familiar woody form.

The male cones face downwards, and aren't as brightly coloured as the
female. They weren't quite mature today, but they'll probably start
shedding pollen this week.

There were a few Trilliums and Bloodroot poking up, but the only showy
spring wildflower I found were a handful of Trout Lilies, <em>Erythronium
americanum</em>.

<figcaption><em>Carex pedunculata</em> in flower</figcaption>
</figure>

<em>Carex pedunculata</em> is one of my favourite spring flowers. It's one
of the earliest, starting with or even before species like <em>Carex
plantaginea</em>. The plants are distinctive, with strongly reddened leaf
bases, and dark red scales - particularly the staminate ones. You might
confuse it with something from section <em>Acrocystis</em>, like <em>C.
pensylvanica</em>. However, <em>C. pedunculata</em> has female spikelets on
long, drooping peduncles arising low on the plant, quite unlike any of the
<em>Acrocystis</em>. When the fruit matures, the perigynia are pubescent,
and can form fleshy elaisomes, another characteristic shared with some of
the <em>Acrocystis</em> species.

This one was part of a big patch on a small ravine slope, but it's pretty
common through the woods here. It's very easy to overlook, though, because
its ant-dispersed fruits are shed and gone before the end of May. There was
a very delicate little <em>Acrocystis</em> sedge growing with it. I'm not
sure what it was, too small for <em>C. pensylvanica</em> or <em>C.
complanata</em>, so I'm guessing <em>C. peckii</em>.

Another one of my favourites is Beaked Hazel - <em>Corylus cornuta</em>.
There was lots of it in the woods today. Another easy-to-miss flower. I
finally got some good pictures of it last year, after trying without
success for many years. Here's one of them:

## Geek notes

Despite lugging my tripod around with me all day, I only used it once or
twice. With the wind blowing, it was not really that helpful. However, I'm
finally coming to terms with modern technology, I think. I got stuck in a
rut where everything I shot was ISO100, on a tripod, stopped down to F40+
to squeeze as much of 'reality' as possible into focus. Working under these
restrictions limited my composition, I finally realized. Today, I left the
camera on ISO200, and sure enough, the sky <em>did not</em> fall. I'm using
a vibration-reduction lens, auto-focus, and a camera-mounted speedlight for
fill-flash, and I'm quite happy with how sharp the images came out. I
switched back to manual focus for the real close-up stuff, and used a pair
of lens-mounted R1 speedlights when I needed a little more control of
lighting, but that's still less bother than a tripod. What do you think?
Let me know how you deal with close-ups of bouncy flowers.
