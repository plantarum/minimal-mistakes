Erling Porsild is a legendary figure in Canadian botany. His personal
accomplishments as an explorer, taxonomist and biogeographer have rightly
earned him a place of honour in Canadian science. More than that, his
career crossed an important transition in floristic research. When he
arrived in this country, vast swaths of the boreal and arctic regions of
Canada had never been visited by biologists. By the end of his career, he
had personally documented the flora of large parts of the Yukon, Northwest
Territories, and the Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the number of places in
Canada's far north that remained unknown to science was shrinking fast.

Wendy Dathan has done an admirable job in compiling Porsild's biography.
This is a fantastically detailed treatment. She starts at the beginning,
which for Porsild was Greenland. He truly was born into the life of an
Arctic botanist, moving to the island of Disko off the west coast of
Greenland when he was five. His father, an accomplished botanist himself,
had the job of establishing a permanent research station in the Danish
colony.

The elder Porsild had some sway with Canadian botanists, and later helped
land Erling and his brother Bob jobs doing survey work in the Yukon. This
was in support of government plans to establish domestic reindeer herds to
support the Inuit communities of the Yukon and Northwest Territories – and
the source of the book's title. Dathan's presentation of this period
presents one of the highlights of the book. The Porsild brothers spent
several years in the northwest. They travelled across the North Slope of
Alaska by dog sled in the dead of winter, followed by further adventures in
boats, canoes and on foot. This would make for gripping reading as a simple
tale of adventure travel. But of course, in addition to all the work
involved in living a mostly self-sufficient life in the often brutal
Arctic, the two brothers dutifully collected and pressed specimens
throughout their journeys.

This work established Erling in Canadian botany. However, it would be many
years before he finally secured a permanent position with the National
Museum. He eventually became the Chief Botanist for the institution, but
only after years in short-term or acting positions.

All the while, he continued to pursue his scientific work. Through
Porsild's struggles to have his work published, Dathan explores his
relationships with his contemporaries, including Oscar Malte, Hugh Raup,
Merritt Fernald, and especially the Swedish botanist Eric Hultén. Hultén
and Porsild were both working on northern floristics, and for years Porsild
saw the Swede as a competitor. Many years later they reached a
reconciliation of sorts, with Porsild realizing that both of their work had
suffered from lack of cooperation. This was a very compelling story, and
another highlight of the book for me.

For those of us that grew up with Farley Mowat's stories, the chapter
covering the heated dispute over Mowat's contentious book, "People of the
Deer" is also very interesting. Porsild, along with many other Arctic
researchers, found Mowat's claim that his book was a factual retelling of
actual events too fantastic to believe. Unfortunately for Porsild, he put
his objections in print. The ensuing dust-up consumed far more time and
energy than Porsild would have liked, particularly for a book he felt had
such little merit.

Dathan's book is a truly monumental effort, and a great service to the
botanical community of Canada. Indeed, she has received awards from the
Alberta Book Awards and the Canadian Historical Association. Her writing is
clear and understated – she provides very little commentary of her own.
Instead, as far as possible, she lets Erling tell his own story, with
extensive quotations from his correspondence. For the most part, this is
very effective.

That said, I do have to take issue with one aspect of her work – at 726
pages, I frequently wished she'd been more willing to omit the less
interesting details of Porsild's life. Every time a boat engine broke, or a
trip was delayed, we read about it, and in far more detail than necessary.
A few of these embellishments add colour to the story. But after 500 pages,
a little restraint would have been appreciated!

In summary, I can highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the
history of exploration in Canada. As a plant taxonomist, I found it
provided a fantastic, and at times jaw-dropping, look at the challenges and
triumphs of one of our scientific forebears. And of course, this should be
required reading for Canadian botanists!
