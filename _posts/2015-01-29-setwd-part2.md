I got lots of response on twitter to my
[previous post](http://plantarum.ca/code/setwd/) on the use of `setwd` in
R. Most of it was positive, but three very valid criticisms were raised
that I'd like to address.

The first, and ultimately most important, came from Joran Elias:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sedgeboy">@sedgeboy</a> Well meaning dogmatism about &quot;right&quot; way is major reason noobs find programming culture off-putting, discouraging.</p>&mdash; Joran Elias (@joranelias) <a href="https://twitter.com/joranelias/status/559912734452510720">January 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

Too right! I wrote as if there was one true way to use R, and that suggests
you need to join a particular in-crowd to be worthy. I can understand how
that attitude will alienate some. Especially considering my point was most
emphatically that there was one correct way to use `setwd` (don't!), and
clearly **that's not true**. Particularly in light of the second issue,
raised by Tim Lucas:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sedgeboy">@sedgeboy</a> Ulimately you have to tell R where the data file is. Whether that&#39;s through setwd or emacs specific is much of a muchness.</p>&mdash; Tim Lucas (@Timcdlucas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Timcdlucas/status/560095707609448448">January 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

This was part of a longer exchange that revealed that Tim and I had been
talking past each other on this key point. I use the Emacs Speaks
Statistics ([ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/)) package to run R from the
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) text editor. The first thing
that happens when I start up R is that ESS prompts me for my working
directory. So I personally never touch `setwd` myself, because that dirty
work has been delegated to Emacs. [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
provides this same service through the file browser window.

However, for people that don't use an interface like this, they have to
explicitly call `setwd` themselves to tell R where to find their files.
This is of course correct and entirely appropriate. I would still argue
that the call to `setwd` should not appear in your actual script file, but
if it was the first line it should be relatively clear to collaborators
what you were doing.

I also got some email raising this issue, so to be clear, everything I said
in my previous post assumes you have some way to get R running in the
appropriate directory, and that may well require you to use `setwd`.

Finally, some examples of `setwd` that are useful and don't undermine
portability. From Gabor Csardi:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">@hadleywickham</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sedgeboy">@sedgeboy</a> I think there is one legit use: doing temporary work in a temp dir, using a `with_wd()` function and `on.exit()`.</p>&mdash; Gabor Csardi (@GaborCsardi) <a href="https://twitter.com/GaborCsardi/status/560075968589864960">January 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>

This is the function he refers to:

{% highlight r %}
with_wd <- function(dir, expr) {
  wd <- getwd()
  on.exit(setwd(wd))
  setwd(dir)
  eval(expr, envir = parent.frame())
}
{% endhighlight %}

Very tidy! `with_wd` saves the current working directory and moves to a new
(temporary) directory. Once there, it executes your code, presumably
creating a bunch of temporary files in the process. On completion, it
restores the original working directory. Combining this with a call to
`tempdir` gives you a nice way to execute code that produces a lot of
temporary files without cluttering up your working directory.

Another good use of `setwd` from Tony Fischetti:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/sedgeboy">@sedgeboy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">@hadleywickham</a> legitimate use of setwd(): taking in a path from cmline arg to do something to all data in a dir <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/doingitright?src=hash">#doingitright</a></p>&mdash; Tony Fischetti (@tonyfischetti) <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyfischetti/status/560283631755993088">January 28, 2015</a></blockquote>

With a little thought I'm sure we could come up with more *exceptions to
prove the rule* that `setwd` should *never* be used. I will leave it at
this: before you use `setwd` in your scripts, consider the impact it will
have on the portability of your code, both to your collaborators, and to
*future you*, who may have to run it on another computer. If there's
another way to accomplish what you need, `setwd` is probably the worse
option.
