## Plant Taxonomy

My primary research focus is **species-level taxonomy**, particularly in
native crops and wild crop relatives. This work typically begins by
delineating discrete groups, using a combination of morphometric and
genetic data. This stems from my background as a field botanist: I am
fascinated by plant diversity, and want to learn to recognize plant species
as discrete, cohesive units. This assumes that species are discrete,
cohesive units, an assumption that is not always met!

Once we have some idea of the species at hand, we can start to ask meatier
evolutionary and ecological questions. I am interested in the relationship
between speciation and niche evolution. I use a combination of field data
and ecological niche modeling to quantify the ecology of species.
Evaluation of this data in a phylogenetic framework is key to understanding
how taxonomic diversity and ecological diversity are related.

## Plant Conservation

I am also interested in the conservation of rare and endangered species. I
have completed a number of COSEWIC species assessments, and prepared the
recovery plan for _Trichophorum planifolium_, a woodland sedge that is
endangered in Canada.


## Current Projects

### Conservation genetics of the Few-Flowered Clubrush, _Trichophorum planifolium_

_Trichophorum planifolium_ persists in a single location in Canada, in the
nature sanctuaries of Royal Botanical Gardens in Hamilton, Ontario. A
second population in the Rouge Valley in Toronto may be extirpated. It is
listed as an endangered species in Canada.

One of the concerns raised in the recovery strategy for this species is
that this isolated northern population may be limited by low genetic
diversity. To address this concern, we are quantifying the genetics of this
population, as well as populations from across the range of the species in
the eastern United States.

We are also analyzing habitat data from these field locations, and using
this information, in combination with niche models, to identify priority
habitat for potential reintroduction of this species in the Rouge Valley.

This is an MSc project for my student Victoria Nowell. It is funded by the
Environment Canada's Interdepartmental Recovery Fund, the Ontario Ministry
of Natural Resources, with additional student support from NSERC and
Carleton University.

### Highbush blackberries, _Rubus_ section _Canadenses_ et al.

_Rubus_ is a taxonomic disaster. The blackberries (subgenus _Eubatus_)
present a special problem. This group combines apomixis (clonal seed
production), hybridization, and polyploidy. The result is incredible
morphological variation that appears to be segregated among discrete
species at the local level, but forms complex gradients across the
continent.

The taxonomic response to _Rubus_ has varied from excessive lumping,
reducing the blackberries to less than 10 species in northeastern North
America; to exuberant splitting, with several hundred named species.
Neither approach is realistic, but the challenges posed by this group have
precluded a better treatment so far.

The first phase of my work is collecting representative samples of highbush
blackberries from across the northeast. I am using a combination of DNA
fingerprinting (AFLPs and microsatellites) and morphometrics to complete a
first-pass at sorting these plants into discrete groups. Once thatâ€™s done,
I will be able to follow up with more detailed work to assess
hybridization, polyploidy and reticulate evolution among species (or
microspecies, as the case may be).

This project was funded by an AAFC Agriflex grant.

### Small-fruited cranberries, _Vaccinium oxycoccos_

The small-fruited cranberry, _Vaccinium oxycoccos_, is a circumboreal
species found in northern peatlands. The diploid cytotype can hybridize
with the commercial large-fruited cranberry (_Vaccinium macrocarpon_), and
may be a valuable resource for future breeding efforts. There are also
polyploid cytotypes of _Vaccinium oxycoccos_. Botanists in Europe and
northern North America have recognized the diploids as a species distinct
from the polyploids, _V. microcarpum_, but the recent Flora of North America
treatment of the group lumped all the cytotypes together as a single
species.

I am interested in recent European work that shows that there is indeed a
distinct morphological difference between diploid and polyploid plants. If
this holds for North American plants, it will support recognizing the
diploids as a distinct species. In the process of evaluating this
hypothesis, I am building genotype, morphometric, and flow cytometry data
sets. These tools will allow me to further explore the genetic relationship
between diploid and polyploid _V. oxycoccos_, the clonal structure of their
populations, and their evolutionary connection to _V. macrocarpon_.

This project was funded by an AAFC Agriflex grant.

## Past Projects

### Environmental Geometry and Emergent Properties of Ecological Communities

My post-doctoral research was an investigation of spatial aspects of
plant community structure. Specifically, I was looking at how the spatial
arrangement of the landscape influenced community richness and diversity,
and how well our existing statistical tools performed in assessing these
parameters.

### Species limits and niche evolution in _Carex_ section _Porocystis_

For my dissertation research, I examined the relationship between taxonomic
diversity and ecological diversity in _Carex_ section _Porocystis_. This
involved conducting field surveys for globally rare species, resolving
species boundaries, and assessing niche divergence.

In service of this project, I assessed the taxonomic issues with AFLP
genotypes, restriction fragments (CAPS), and morphometrics. For the
ecological issues, I combined ecological niche modeling (Maxent) with
multivariate analysis of field data.
