## R

Tutorial materials I've been creating for workshops and courses:

- A guided tour of the [R command line interface](/assets/docs/first_session.pdf).

- My tutorial on
  [customizing Râ€™s base graphics plots](/assets/docs/publication_plots.pdf)
  for publication. 

- My HTML5 slide deck introducing a
  [reproducible research](/assets/docs/r-markdown.html) workflow using R,
  markdown and knitr in Rstudio (opens as a webpage; "Save Link As" to
  download it if you want a local copy).

- My current [.Rnw template](/assets/docs/knitr.Rnw), for use when
  producing pdfs via [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and
  [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org). This is the basis of the graphics
  tutorial above.

I have a slowly growing repository of
[R teaching material](https://github.com/plantarum/r-training) as well.

## Emacs

[grass-mode](https://bitbucket.org/tws/grass-mode.el/wiki/Home), my
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) mode for interacting with the
[GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org/) software package. Inspired by
[ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/).
