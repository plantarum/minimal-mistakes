1. Purchase the droplet
   - 32GB RAM, 12 CPUs, Debian 7 x64
2. Login as root
   - password is emailed to you
   - ssh root@104.131.222.81
3. Change root password
4. Add regular user
   adduser tyler (enter password)
5. Generate ssh key on local computer
   - ssh-keygen -t rsa
   - passphrase is not necessary here
6. Transfer key to cloud host
   - ssh-copy-id tyler@104.131.222.81
   - you need to enter the password for this user
7. Test logging in:
   ssh tyler@104.131.222.81
8. If you login successfully without a password, the rsa key is properly
   installed
9. On the remote machine, su to root user, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   - PermitRootLogin no (only login as normal user)
   - PasswordAuthentication no (only login via ssh key, no passwords)
   - To use X:
     - /etc/ssh/ssh_config
     - ForwardX11 yes
10. Reload ssh
   /etc/init.d/ssh reload

11. Install necessary programs:
    aptitude
    u (update)
    g g (install security updates)

    install other programs:
    grass
    emacs
    screen and/or tmux
    htop
    avce00
    e00compr
    git
    mercurial
    xorg

12. Make grassdata directory in ~/ on remote machine

13. Transfer files from local to remote:
    rsync -az --progress --compresslevel=9 --partial grassdata/trich_ast_ll tyler@104.131.222.81:grassdata/

    z is important -compress files before sending them, reduces transit
    times by 2/3s!

14. When you're ready, run screen
    - key point - C-a d will detach the session, allowing you to log out
      and leave the processes running. `screen -r` reattaches to the last
      detached session.

15. Run GRASS!
    - r.slope.aspect, 500MB of RAM
