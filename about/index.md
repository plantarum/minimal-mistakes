I am a plant taxonomist and conservation biologist. I work for Agriculture
and Agrifood Canada, where I am responsible for researching the Taxonomy of
Canadian Native Crops. I am also an adjunct professor in the Biology
department at Carleton University. This is my personal website, and the
views expressed here are my own. What you find here are my own ideas on
plant taxonomy research, field botany, and related items. The sorts of
things that will show up here: teaching notes, working keys, software
tools, and comments on the practice and products of plant taxonomy.
