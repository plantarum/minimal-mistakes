## Flora of Ontario

The following key is derived from the
[Flora of North America](http://www.fna.org), based on data scraped from the
website using a Python program I am writing. It’s not yet complete, but
hopefully I’ll have most of the Cyperaceae covered before the spring. Check
back for updates!

UPDATE: March 18, 2013
{: .notice}

The key now contains all the Ontario _Carex_. In theory, it is now complete,
except for _Cyperus_. _Cyperus_ isn’t online, so it will have to be added
by hand. All the rest of the sedges are there now. The next step will be
checking for translation errors, and rationalizing the keys.

UPDATE: August 13, 2016
{: .notice}

I added the _Cyperus_ key by hand, and corrected ca. 25 species that didn't get imported properly from the FNA webpages.
